Note: The 'blockheight.db' is a legacy artifact from NXT 1.1.6, which does not have the api call 'getBlockId'
This feature will be removed with the transition to NXT 1.2.0



The Bridge - access the NXT blockchain using legacy bitcoind jsonrpc calls
 
purpose: communicate with the NXT blockchain by using bitcoind jsonrpc calls
 


operation: 

 

run bitcoind with rpc enabled
run NRS (NXT server)
run nxtBridge.py [args]

args: [nxtNET, walletFile]

nxtNET = testNet or mainNet           default: testNet
walletFile = filename for nxtWallet   default: nxtWallet.dat

At startup, nxtBridge checks for existence of the sqlite3 db 'walletFile'.
If it exists, it opens this db, if it does not exist, it creates a new one with one address and "" as accountName.


1:
-------------------------------------
bitcoind can be used as a relay to forward jsonrpc calls that are sent to it to another port:

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getinfo 

Calls bitcoind from the command line with 'getinfo', and bitcoind forwards the 'getinfo' jsonrpc call to port 7879

Notes: 

- bitcoind is listening on the rpcport as designated in bitcoin.conf, default is 8332

- sending 'getinfo' as jsonrpc to port 8332 does the same as the cmd line in the example above.

- nxtBridge can vbe called directly by sending bitcoind comprehensible json to port 7879 w/o running bitcoind

- bitcoind uses malformed jsonrpc with several of its api calls. 
  The 'curl' tool is not able to hanlde this. nxtBridge might support this in the future also, but not at present.
 


2:
-------------------------------------
nxtBridge listens on port 7879 for jsonrpc calls that are sent there in bitcoind format.

This can be done either by relaying to there from bitcoind, i.e. by sending the calls to bitcoind on port 8332,

OR directly by sending them to port 7879

nxtBridge receives a jsonrpc call from bitcoind.

nxtBridge internally maps the jsonrpc call from bitcoind to associated NXT api call(s)

nxtBridge queries the designated NRS instance - currently hardcoded running on the same machine as the bridge,
but can be easily modified

nxtBridge receives the replie(s) from the NRS and maps them back to a format that is congruent to bitcoind

nxtBridge returns the bitcoind-'congruent' message
   


-------------------------------------
 
Example using shell call to bitcoind:

Alice@myBox:~/bitcoin-0.9.1-linux/bin/64$./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getinfo
{
    "connections" : 56,
    "errors" : "",
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "keypoololdest" : 769654784,
    "keypoolsize" : 326764176,
    "proxy" : "",
    "version" : "1.2.0e",
    "timeoffset" : 0,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "protocolversion" : "1.2.0e",
    "blocks" : 142754,
    "walletversion" : "1.2.0e",
    "difficulty" : "2552571948492161",
    "testnet" : false
}

This call contains data from the NXT blockchain, and is returned by the Bridge via bitcoind.
The parameters returned represent the NXT blockchain.

Note the differences of values to current bitcoin blockchain parameters.

Wallet emulation
----------------

DISCLAIMER
OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES:

1: PREVENT SECURITY BREACHES OF YOUR OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.
2: PREVENT LOSS OF THE WALLET FILE.

THE SQLITE3 DATABASE THAT CONTAINS THE NXT PASSWORDS FOR THE NXT ACCOUNTS ARE STORED WITHOUT ENCRYPTION IN THE SQLITE3 DATABASE FILE.
A SECURITY BREACH OF THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MAY LEAD TO THEFT OF FUNDS HELD IN THESE ACCOUNTS.
PASSWORD PROTECTION OF THE SQLITE3 DATABASE CAN BE ADDED EASILY BY ANYBODY WITH MODERATE PYTHON PROFICIENCY.
HENCE, PREVENT SECURITY BREACHES OF YOUR OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

LOSS OF THE WALLET FILE LEADS TO LOSS OF ACCESS TO THE NXT FUNDS REPRESENTED BY THE NXT PASSPHRASES.
HENCE, PREVENT LOSS OF THE WALLET FILE.


NXT does not have a 'wallet' feature as bitcoin does.
nxtBridge emulates this by maintaining a bitcoin-wallet-like database (sqlite3).

The filename can be supplied at startup, and if THE corresponding sqlite3.db does not exist, it will be created.
If the wallet.dat sqlite3 db already exists, it will be continued.

Since extensive use of the 'accounts' feature is somewhat discouraged by the bitcoin developers,
nxtBridge makes a slight restriction on its use.

nxtBridge enforces a strict 1-1 mapping of the arbitrary account names against the NXT addresses.

The first account that is created automatically upon the creation of nxtWallet will be "" the an account
that is associated with the empty string.

Subsequent calls to the 'getnewaddress' must supply an account name that does not yet exist in nxtWallet.
If an account name is supplied with the 'getnewaddress' call that already exists, an error will be returned.


Recommendations for operational security:

The same security guidelines as for running a bitcoin wallet apply.
Furthermore, the sqlite3 database is not encrypted, hence anybody obtaining access to this file can access the funds to all NXT funds
contained in the NXT accounts represented by the passwords.

Possible security measures: Set up an encrypted file container and mount it in the filesystem.
Then use this file system in the encrypted file container to store the wallet.dat db file. Use eg truecrypt.

Use an in-memory file system location to host the wallet.dat durig operations,
and store backups of the wallet.dat file in an encrypted file container.

Also, some slite3 security extensions exist:
sqlite-crypt.com/documentation.htm
www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html


Run your whole system from an encrypted LVM.

Protect against loss of wallet.dat - when the api call 'getnewaddress' is issued, a new entry will be made in the wallet.dat.
Since making a backup of wallet.dat every time a 'getnewaddress' is issued is unfeasible, the following solution can be used:
Configure a python logger to send an email to an external mail system, with the email containing the added (accountName, accountNum, accountMen, PASSWORD)
in an encrypted form.





getbalance # under revision
----------
without parameter returns the sum of the balances of all NXT addresses in the wallet
with "" as parameter return the balance of the NXT address associated with the account named by the empty string ""
with "accountName" as parameter return the balance of the NXT address associated with the account named "accountName"


./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getbalance 2865886802744497404 1

listunspent # under revision
-----------
without parameter returns list of balances of all NXT addresses in the wallet from the NXT blockchain
with a  parameter (=nxtAddress) returns the balance of the NXT address from the NXT blockchain.


getreceivedbyaccount # under revision
--------------------
returns the sum of all payments received by this address and the associated account

getreceivedbyaddress # under revision
--------------------
returns the sum of all payments received by this address and the associated account







Below are examples for the implemented bitcoind calls using the curl tool, given with two different parameter syntaxes.
These have been tested on Ubuntu13.10




./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getconnectioncount

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getinfo

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getreceivedbyaccount 2865886802744497404

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 getreceivedbyaddress 2865886802744497404

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 gettransaction 1448848043607985937

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 sendfrom XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 16159101027034403504 1.2340 1 comm1 commTo 

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 settxfee

./bitcoind -rpcport=7879 validateaddress XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
